/// Functional tests of incremental builds.  These are fairly ad hoc at this
/// point, and because of the time they take, they need to be kept minimal.
/// There are at least a couple of ways in which this could be improved to a
/// greater or lesser degree:
///
/// a) we could look at the llbuild manifest to determine that the right fine-
///    grained dependencies exist (however, this feels a bit too much like a
///    "test that we wrote what we wrote" kind of test, i.e. it doesn't really
///    test that the net effect of triggering rebuilds is achieved; it is also
///    hard to write such tests in a black-box manner, i.e. in terms of the
///    desired effect
///
/// b) a much better way would be if llbuild could quickly report on what files
///    it would update if a build were to be triggered;  this would be a lot
///    faster than actually doing the build, but would of course also bake in
///    an assumption that the needs-to-be-rebuilt state of a file system entity
///    could be determined without running any of the commands (i.e. it would
///    assume that there's no feedback during the build)
